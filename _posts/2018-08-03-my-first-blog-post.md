Gaming has evolved over the decades, what began as a few computer scientists messing around became an established art form. Many games today are display cinematic quality equal to some of Hollywoods top films. Modern video games favour graphic fidelity over quality writing and gameplay.

What ever did happen to the brilliant writing seen in classic titles?


I would argue that some of the best written games in history came out in the 90’s and early 2000’s. Many modern games are well written but one can’t deny the sheer amount of top quality games that came out during that period. When I think of great writing, they are two dominant genres that outputted classics, point and click adventure games and the RPG genre. Let’s get into the reasons why these two genres produced such well written games.

First we take a look at the contrast between these two genres. On one hand we have an adventure game that is usually linear in design, where the dialogue is usually based in and around puzzles. The strength of linear games lies with the power of being able to create a good story and stick to it. You deny player freedom but cut variables that impact the story, in turn all your focus and attention can go towards creating a good one. Sierra and Lucas Arts were popular in bringing this genre to the mainstream. Telltale Games creates many modern adventure games evolved from this genre.

On the other side we have RPG’s or Role-playing games. These games are usually non-linear and often open-world or contain large instances allowing the player to explore a wider area. The strength of RPG games is in it’s ability to allow the player to choose  his own story or impact the story to a measurable degree.  This results in having to write a lot more dialogue. Many games in this genre can fall into the trap of filler dialogue, this is a lot more  predominant in modern RPG’s. Having a wide cast of characters with the same personality and standard responses is not usually a staple of the classic RPG.

Most RPG’s have a main plot but could contain many different endings. Endings can vary depending on the users choices and quests completed throughout the game. RPG’s can be rewarding in the short term for a player as many of these games can contain side quests or activities that can offer the player a break from the main goal of the game.  This also works from the standpoint of the writer  too, although the RPG genre involves more writing, these short stories give the writer a break from the overarching and sometimes daunting main story and creates a wider avenue for inspiration and addition to the main plot.
