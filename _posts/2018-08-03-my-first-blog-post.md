Gaming has evolved heavily over the decades, beginning with a bunch of computer scientists messing about with CRT monitors quickly became an art form with many games today being borderline cinematic displays but as game engine capabilities got higher, modern video games often favor graphics and cinematics over writing and gameplay.

As I'm writing this article, I would like to state this is not an argument for how writing is important in video games, as many know it depends on the style of the game, I'm arguing those modern games that have included a story but have subpar writing.

I would argue that some of the best written games in history came out in the 90's and early 2000's, there are many modern games with brilliant writing but one can't deny the sheer amount of top quality writing in games that came out during that period, when I think of great writing, I think of "Planescape Torment", "Grim Fandango", ""
